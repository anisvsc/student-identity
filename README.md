# Aptos Student Identity NFT

This project is a React application that interacts with the Aptos blockchain to manage student identity NFTs. Users can connect their wallets, view their identity details, and create a new identity on the blockchain.

## Features

- Connect to Aptos wallet
- Fetch and display user identity from the blockchain
- Add a new student identity NFT
- Responsive design using Ant Design components

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (or yarn)
- An Aptos wallet (e.g., Martian Wallet, Petra)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aptos-student-identity-nft.git
cd aptos-student-identity-nft
```
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```env
REACT_APP_APTOS_NODE=https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the development server. You can view the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Click the "Connect Wallet" button to link your Aptos wallet.
2. **View Identity**: If you have an identity already stored, it will be displayed. Otherwise, you can create a new one.
3. **Add New Identity**: Fill out the form with your name, enrollment year, and major, then click "Add New Identity" to submit it to the blockchain.

## Code Overview

### Main Component

The main component of the application handles the wallet connection, fetching identity data, and submitting new identities.

```javascript
const Main = () => {
  // Component logic here
};
```

### Key Functions

- `fetchIdentity`: Retrieves the user's identity from the blockchain.
- `addNewIdentity`: Submits a transaction to create a new identity NFT.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, consider the following:

- Ensure that the module `student_identity_nft` is correctly deployed on the Aptos blockchain.
- Double-check that your wallet is connected and has sufficient funds to cover transaction fees.
- Verify the module address and naming conventions used in the code.
